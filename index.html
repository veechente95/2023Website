      <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-me">Hey, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Vicente Ceja (he/him), 
      from Boyle Heights, California. I'm a self-taught python developer and a recent Data 
      Engineering Fellow at Data Science for All by Correlation One seeking to launch a career 
      in the world of tech. I graduated from UCLA back in 2018 with a B.A in Geographic Information Systems and Technology (GIS&T) and have a background working with spatial analysis and data management. On my freetime I love to code, cook, record music, workout, and bake cookies (hence the little favicon above on your browser tab).

        <h3>Embracing Vulnerability: My Journey into the World of Tech and Code</h3>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by the world of tech but was clueless as to where to start and sometimes felt like I was never good enough. However, I learned to accept the vulnerability and excitement to start again, stretch my limits, and teach myself how to code.

        <h3>Data Science for All by Correlation One</h3>
        <p>During this 16-week Data Engineering fellowship, I collaborated with a team to analyze the predictability of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance API and Alpha Vantage. We built a data pipeline using Python and Amazon S3 and achieved 95% accuracy while analyzing extensive datasets through Pandas, SQL, and Excel. I presented our findings, along with Tableau visualizations, to an audience of 200+, ensuring accessibility for both technical and non-technical individuals. Additionally, I created a detailed project plan, incorporating guidance from industry data engineers, to keep our deliverables on track with biweekly meetings.

      <h3>My Goal</h3>
      <p>As a first generation Mexican-American, I acknowledge the lack of
        diversity in traditional STEM fields and want to break the stigma by providing a
        diverse open door for future POC and Latinx folks coming from different communities,
        backgrounds and technical abilities. I want to use my story to help guide others
        who may have also experienced similar cases of imposter syndrome and help inspire them.
