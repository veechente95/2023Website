    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="about-me">Hey, thanks for visiting my website! My name is Vicente Ceja (he/him), 
      from Boyle Heights, California. I'm a self-taught python developer and a recent Data 
      Engineering Fellow at Data Science for All by Correlation One seeking to launch a career 
      in the world of tech. I graduated from UCLA back in 2018 with a B.A in Geographic Information Systems and Technology (GIS&T) and have a background working with spatial analysis and data management. On my freetime I love to code, cook, record music, workout, and bake cookies (hence the little favicon above on your browser tab).

    <h3>Embracing Vulnerability: My Journey into the World of Tech and Code</h3>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by the world of tech but was clueless as to where to start and sometimes felt like I was never good enough. HoweverI learned to accept the vulnerability and excitement to start again, stretch my limits, anteach myself how to code.

    <h3>My Goal</h3>
    <p>As a first generation Mexican-American, I acknowledge the lack of
      diversity in traditional STEM fields and want to break the stigma by providing a
      diverse open door for future POC and Latinx folks coming from different communities,
      backgrounds and technical abilities. I want to use my story to help guide others
      who may have also experienced similar cases of imposter syndrome and help inspire them.
